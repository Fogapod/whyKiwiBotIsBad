## Why you should never ever use KiwiBot


### Introduction
In this arcticle I'll try to prove that KiwiBot is one of the worst and sure is the most useless bot that can be found on discord and why following [these](https://github.com/Fogapod/discord-bot-challenges) rules doesn't help it.

### Appearence
<img height=256 src=.github/avatar.png>
First thing you see in any bot is it's avatar and name these make bot unique. Let's take a look at KiwiBot.  
You think there's some story behind choosing kiwi as a mascot? Hell no. Authors imagination just died and this is the result. This bot has nothing to do with innocent kiwi birds used without New Zealand government permission.

### Perfomance
KiwiBot is written in python which makes it extremely slow.

### Application
It tries to be a multi-purpose bot and obviously can't do any of it's tasks properly.  
Bot has a vast range of commands:
* ~~Image manipulation~~ (not even a thing yet)
* Moderation
* Translators
* Voice-based commands
* Text generation
* Commands for gathering info about discord objects (users, channels, etc.)
* And more
How do you imagine a single bot managing doing all of that? (if it isn't NotSoBot)

### Ratelimits
KiwiBot has relatively low ratelimits. It means users can spam commands and easily break it.

### Command cancellation
I deleted my message and bot deleted response, what?????

### Uptime
The following image clearly demonstartes poor bot's uptime. It shows how owner doesn't care about it. Think about uptime this way: every 100th minute you can say that bot is down with the confidense of 65%.

This image is done by Belphegor, much better discord bot. You can check it out [here](https://github.com/nguuuquaaa/Belphegor).

### Money
KiwiBot doesn't have annoying Patreon baits offering you lower ratelimits or exclusive commands access for $1 or more. It means bot owner will just run out of money eventually and delete the bot without the ability to pay for hosting anymore.

### Source code
KiwiBot's source code can be found [here](http://github.com/Fogapod/KiwiBot), but wait, don't open it!  
This repository contains enormous amount of dirty, overcomplicated spaghetti code and all kinds of programming anti-patterns.  
It can be useful only if you're looking for an example of bad python code. Then go for it. There should be enough material for a few novels at least.

### Conclusion
In this article I examined the most obvious disadvantages of KiwiBot, but there are much more.  
I hope it was useful and convinced you not to invite KiwiBot to your server at [admin](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=394793577160376320&scope=bot&permissions=8) | [no admin](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=394793577160376320&scope=bot&permissions=2146958583) and delete it from your server if it's already in.
